### Indiana Jones 
Indiana Jones often faces difficult dilemmas in his travels. On his last journey
into the crypt on a long-forgotten emperor he found countless treasures but he could
only carry no more than *N* kilograms of loot on the way back. Help him make
the most of the situation by solving the famous
[*knapsack problem*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). Since
he'll be using the program for some time, we are required to solve the problem
using **both** dynamic programming **AND** branch & bound.

For example:

```
